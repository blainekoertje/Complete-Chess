# Complete-Chess
Project 4
Author: Blaine Koertje

For this Project we created a Chess Game. It was pretty difficult, and at some points it was too late to fix the program. I wish I would have created my board differently
and relied on Objects(Chess Pieces) instead of Strings. It was much more difficult to move pieces and such.

One Problem I have is my turnCounter. If a user makes an invalid move then they lose their turn, and it switches back. I thought it would be easy to fix this after I got the little kinks out
of the other parts of the program, but it wasn't. I'm actually ok with this. From what I understand Chess is a very serious game, and if a user is making mistakes like moving pieces to places
they shouldn't then they SHOULD LOSE THEIR TURN! There is no room for mistakes in Chess, and this program isn't a tutorial. For SERIOUS CHESS PLAYERS ONLY! Other than that it works pretty good/
